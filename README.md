- **[reduxToolkittodo](./reduxToolkittodo/)** - Todo app rebuilt with Redux Toolkit for state management

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** - Core library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **Context API** - React's built-in state management
- **Local Storage** - Browser storage for persistence
- **REST APIs** - External data fetching

## 📖 Learning Resources

### 📄 **Documentation Files**
- **[HOOKS.md](./HOOKS.md)** - Comprehensive React Hooks reference guide for myself
- **[REACTFIBRE.md](./REACTFIBRE.md)** - Understanding React's reconciliation algorithm

### 🎓 **Credits**
Special thanks to **Hitesh Choudary** from **Chai aur Code** for the excellent React tutorial series that guided this learning journey.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is self-contained with its own dependencies. To run any project:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
